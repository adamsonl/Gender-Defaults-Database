But the length of an utterance may also correspond to the extent to which it conveys new or unfamiliar information. Reduced form may thus be an economically motivated index of familiarity. Much of the arbitrariness of grammatical structure arises where equally plausible motivations such as iconicity and economy are, in effect, competing for expression on the same linguistic dimension.},

@article{Romero2013modalsuperlatives,
	abstract = {Superlative adjectives accompanied by certain modal adjectives like possible (e.g. John bought the largest possible present) are ambiguous between a reading where possible is a regular noun modifier and a reading paraphrasable as `as Adj as possible', called `modal superlative reading'. Three interesting restrictions have been observed in the literature. First, possible and some other adjectives ending in -able, but not potential and probable, support the latter reading. Second, when the modal adjective appears postnominally, only the modal superlative reading is available. Third, prenominal possible needs to be in a local configuration to -est in order for the modal superlative reading to arise. Using LF structures independently motivated for degree constructions, the present paper develops a compositional semantic analysis of the modal superlative reading, makes correct new predictions concerning this reading, and---by reconciling previous, opposed syntactic analyses---allows us to derive the three empirical restrictions above. The key innovations are: (i) the previously proposed constituent [possible ▲ellipsis] is interpreted as an amount relative clause, and (ii) this constituent is treated as overtly expressing the comparison class argument of -est.},

We derive a generalization originally outlined in Williams 1974 that the scope of the comparative degree quantifier is exactly as high as the site of attachment of the degree clause. This generalization is shown to follow from the derivational mechanism of countercyclic merger and a semantic property of the comparative degree head, namely, its nonconservativity },

@article{Heringa2012,
	abstract = {This paper presents a multidominance analysis for appositional constructions. It is argued that appositions are related to their anchors in two ways. First, these two elements are coordinated. Second, the apposition functions as the predicate of the anchor. The predication relation is argued to have the structure of a full copular CP, parenthetically related to the anchor. In this secondary clause, the anchor is represented by a (silent) pronoun, while the apposition functions simultaneously as the predicate of the copular CP and as the second conjunct to the anchor. This analysis is used to explain the case marking patterns on appositions in several languages. It is proposed that both the coordinative structure and the predicative structure assign a case feature to the apposition. Which of these features is spelled out is decided by language-specific rules in PF, also depending on the semantic type of the apposition.},

@article{Roehrs2015,
	abstract = {In order to contribute to the understanding of the nature of inflection, this paper investigates the endings on pre-nominal adjectives in four Germanic languages: Dutch, Norwegian, German, and Yiddish. Incorporating detailed observations about Yiddish in general and non-canonical nominals in particular, this study confirms Harbert's (The Germanic languages, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2007) classification of the Mainland Scandinavian languages as semantically determining their inflections but of German as encoding case, number, and gender on its endings. The latter is shown to be regulated by lexical factors. Dutch is grouped with Norwegian and Yiddish with German. While all four languages differ in their details, the paper proposes that compared to Dutch, the Norwegian weak inflections require a subset of definiteness (sub-)components and that in comparison to German, the Yiddish weak inflections require a subset of lexical triggers. Whereas weak endings only surface inside DPs, which are necessarily definite in Dutch and Norwegian, strong endings are shown to appear in more diverse contexts. Given the language-specific conditions on the distribution of the weak inflections, the strong endings are interpreted as the elsewhere case in all languages.},

	abstract = {As discussed by Kiparsky (1968), historical changes in grammatical structures provide the best ``window'' on the actual composition of these structure in so far as we expect that the components of the structures play a role in the changes.The morphological changes we observe in the historical development of the Perfect and past Participle forms in Italo-Romance are most adequately accounted when analyzed in terms of the following components:            (i)  Morphemes such as roots, thematic vowels, and Tense;            (ii)  Vocabulary Items, rules that add phonological material to morphemes;                                MP Rules, morphosyntactically conditioned phonological rules,These components are also crucial to account for the allomorphy  of these forms synchronically.  Both in the diachrony and in the synchrony of Italo-Romance we observe a correlation between presence vs. absence of regular morphology and presence vs. absence of thematic vowels.  This correlation can be easily accounted for if the morphemes are organized in syntactic structures governed by locality principles.},

@article{Smithetal2018,
	abstract = {Suppletion for case and number in pronominal paradigms shows robust patterns across a large, cross-linguistic survey. These patterns are largely, but not entirely, parallel to patterns described in Bobaljik (2012) for suppletion for adjectival degree. Like adjectival degree suppletion along the dimension positive < comparative < superlative, if some element undergoes suppletion for a category X, that element will also undergo suppletion for any category more marked than X on independently established markedness hierarchies for case and number. We argue that the structural account of adjectival suppletive patterns in Bobaljik (2012) extends to pronominal suppletion, on the assumption that case (Caha 2009) and number (Harbour 2011) hierarchies are structurally encoded. In the course of the investigation, we provide evidence against the common view that suppletion obeys a condition of structural (Bobaljik 2012) and/or linear (Embick 2010) adjacency (cf. Merchant 2015; Moskal and Smith 2016), and argue that the full range of facts requires instead a domain-based approach to locality (cf. Moskal 2015b). In the realm of number, suppletion of pronouns behaves as expected, but a handful of examples for suppletion in nouns show a pattern that is initially unexpected, but which is, however, consistent with the overall view if the Number head is also internally structurally complex. Moreover, variation in suppletive patterns for number converges with independent evidence for variation in the internal complexity and markedness of number across languages.},

	abstract = {In this paper I examine in some detail the declension of Latvian nouns and adjectives in the light of a descriptive framework for morphology that I have developed in a number of recent papers (Halle 1990a, 1990b). The data examined provide clear evidence for the need to distinguish gender from inflection class, a distinction that is also supported by the facts from other languages reviewed in this volume in the papers by Harris, Hoberman, and Aronoff. In addition --- and perhaps more importantly --- the Latvian facts illuminate the central role played in the morphology by --- what I have called --- abstract morphemes and shed interesting new light on the ordering of rules, in particular, on the issue of disjunctive rule order and default rules.},
